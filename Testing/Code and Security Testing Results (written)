Results of Security Testing:
Test 1:
The first test was the Start Menu Validation. 
Any option aside from "1, 2, 3, 4" should show error and then reset to have user enter a valid number in the 1-4 range.
I tested the numbers 64, 9, -1, 1.1, 2.1, 0, and 5. Additionally I tested the characters "a" and the string "opal."
All of the test units mentioned above did result in an  error. Therefore, the functionality passes the test.

Test 2: 
The second test was File Path Validation. The purpose of this test was to ensure the program would 
result in an error if an invalid file path is given.
I tested the file paths:
(a) C:alexi/7201/docs
(b) it_is_fine_I_am_OK
(c) C:\Users\alexi\IdeaProjects9 (the correct address in this case is C:\Users\alexi\IdeaProjects)
(d) Main.java
(e) 23445976
All of the file paths listed above resulted in:
  Uh oh! File location not found!
  Please input a filepath: 
The program successfully notified the user that the file location was not found.
Then the program successfully prompts the user to enter a filepath again.

Some exceptions to this rule:
(f) The file path: C:\ Users \ alexi \ IdeaProjects resulted in the following error message:
Exception in thread "main" java.nio.file.InvalidPathException: Trailing char < > at index 9: C:\ Users \ alexi \ IdeaProjects

The correct file path is C:\Users\alexi\IdeaProjects but when spaces were entered between the address it results in an error.
The file path C:\Users\alexi\IdeaProjects (a valid file path with no spaces) does work.

(g) The file path: \Users\alexi\IdeaProjects resulted in the following error message:
File location successfully located.
Error.
java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot invoke "java.nio.file.Path.getFileSystem()" because "path" is null
Would you like to continue with another task or exit?
he file path C:\Users\alexi\IdeaProjects (a valid file path with the 'C:' before the path) does work.
