Code and Security Testing Overview  
In this document - What tests need to be carried out and why is explained.

There are seven code-specific tests to be conducted. 
These tests are:
From the startup menu:
- When the user inputs 1
- When the user inputs 2
- When the user inputs 3
- When the user inputs 4
Once the user is prompted to the backup functionality:
- When the user prompted to enter a source/destination path
Once the user is prompted that their backup was successful "success!":
- User reruns or exits 
For the program to open in terminal:
- User clicks on icon

The purpose of each of these tasks is now below:
From the startup menu: // The purpose of the startup menu is to have an organized destination to begin from.
- When the user inputs 1 // The purpose of the user inputting 1 is so the user can manually select.
- When the user inputs 2 // The purpose of the user inputting 2 is so the user can pick a preset.
- When the user inputs 3 // The purpose of the user inputting 3 is so the user can create a preset.
- When the user inputs 4 // The purpose of the user inputting 4 is so the user can delete a preset.
Once the user is prompted to the backup functionality:
- When the user prompted to enter a source/destination path // The purpose of entering a source path is to know where the file is coming from.
  // The purpose of entering a destination path is to know where the file is going to.
Once the user is prompted that their backup was successful "success!":
- User reruns or exits // The purpose of rerunning is to keep users within our software platform.
  // The purpose of exiting is to quit the program and stop running.
For the program to open in terminal:
- User clicks on icon // The purpose of a clickable icon is for the user to be able to open the software application.
  // Additionally, an icon creates an association with our specific software. It is likewise helpful for a user's organization when they have our software on their computer.
