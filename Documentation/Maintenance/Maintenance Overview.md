# Maintenance Overview

Updated versions of our program will contain either some or all forms of maintenance.
Maintenance administered to the system will fall in one of three categories:
1. Security Patches
2. Bug Fixes
3. Feature Updates

### Security Patches
Security patches are likely our most important form of maintenance. Security patches will be administered if either (1)
the program is found to contain a previously unknown vulnerability, or (2) a zero-day exploit is discovered that puts our
program at risk. In either scenario, we would create and publish a security patch, urging users to patch the program as
soon as possible.

### Bug Fixes
Another important form of maintenance we will administer is bug fixes. For the sake of this plan, we are considering bug 
fixes to include any bug or error with the program that doesn't fall under the category of a "Security Patch". Although bug
fixes are certainly important to us, they are prioritized slightly below a security patch since they indicate a program
functionality flaw rather than a program security flaw. As more users adopt our system, they will likely experience bugs we
did not catch. This is due to the breadth of both the systems used and commands entered. Once a user reports a bug fix to us,
we can begin corrective measures and release a fix.

### Feature Updates
Although likely less urgent than security patches and bug fixes, regularly updating features will allow our program to continually
become more useful and user-friendly. Feature updates would likely include things like additional menu options, additional preset
capabilities and options, and more extensive backup functionalities.
