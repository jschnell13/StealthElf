# Maintenance Timeline

The following maintenance timeline outlines when we would administer different types of maintenance for
our Stealth Elf system.

The following topics will be discussed:
1. Regular Maintenance Checks
2. Quarterly Updates
3. Annual Security Audit
4. End of Support
5. End of Life

### Regular Maintenance Checks
Every month, our team will review system logs and user feedback to identify any potential issues that need
to be addressed via a security patch or bug fix. If a blaring issue is present, a patch or fix will immediately 
be scheduled to quickly be created and dispatched.

### Quarterly Updates
Every quarter, we will strive to update our program with feature updates. Additionally, if any of the security issues
or bugs found in the regular maintenance checks have not had a patch released, then their fix or patch
will be included in the quarterly update.

### Annual Security Audit
Every year, our team will employ a comprehensive security audit of our system. This will include external penetration
tests to assess the security of our system. Internally, our team will update the code to reflect any new security
protocols or best practices. Each time this yearly audit is conducted, everything will be assessed. We do not want to
assume that any feature is safe just because we deemed it safe one year ago. We want to be aware that updates we applied
throughout the year could have potentially introduced security issues to the system that we were unaware of.

### End of Support
The end of support date is set to be March 8th, 2029. Considering March 8th, 2024 as the release date, this means that
support will cease for the system 5 years after it is released.

### End of Life
We will consider our end of life date to be the same as our end of support date. Thus, our program's end of life will be
March 8th, 2029. We made this decision because we want to strongly discourage users from continuing to utilize the program
after security patches and bug fixes will no longer be available.
