A Timeline - Produce a graphical timeline that indicates milestones and when you meet them. Include security milestones.
A Problem Statement - In this document outline: 1) what the problem is, 2) why a solution is needed, 3) what void is being filled, and 4) who will use your system
Try your hand at building some Problem Frames
An Outcome Summary - Outline what your expected outcomes will be in more detail. What will the final product be?
A Security Statement - Create a statement concerning the security outcomes and how security will be applied to the problem and the outcomes stated in the Problem Statement and Outcome Summary
Each of these documents must be well-formatted, concise, and professional. Avoid misspellings, bad grammar, and disorganization. Place these in the Planning section of your physical documentation and upload all these documents to your GitHub repo. KEEP THINGS ORGANIZED ON THE REPO.


## 4.3 - Requirements
During the Requirements Phase you will need to produce four requirements documents:

User Requirements - What do the users require for the system to work? How will they access the system?
Hardware Requirements - What types of hardware components and systems will be needed?
Software Requirements - What kind of software packages will be needed in design, development, and deployment? Include your programming languages here.
Security Requirements - For each of the documents above, what are the matching security requirements?
When completed, please place these documents and any diagrams/images into a section called Requirements in your physical documentation. Place your Requirements Docs on your repo.
